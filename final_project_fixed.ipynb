        "\n",
        "In our project, we are creating NutriGuide, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to give safe, evidence-based nutrition guidance. We built this system because we wanted to create a tool that doesn’t rely on random internet information, but instead pulls directly from trusted health sources like Canada’s Food Guide and the World Health Organization. Our chatbot uses retrieval to gather verified information and a language model to summarize it into clear, simple responses. Since we are focusing on general healthy eating, our system avoids giving medical or extreme diet advice and instead supports users with educational nutrition information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "While working on this project, we realized how difficult it is for people to access reliable nutrition information online. Many websites, influencers, and social media platforms share conflicting or unsafe diet advice, which can easily confuse users. A lot of people end up relying on viral trends instead of evidence-based recommendations. We wanted to solve this problem by building a chatbot that only uses trustworthy public-health information and provides consistent, safe guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**significance**\n",
        "\n",
        "As we researched different ideas, we quickly saw how much misinformation exists in the nutrition space. This problem felt meaningful to us because we noticed that students, newcomers to Canada, and busy individuals often struggle to identify what is actually healthy or safe. Since we are working with official health sources, our project gives users a way to access dependable information without having to navigate complex government websites. To us, the significance of this project lies in making nutrition education more accessible, culturally neutral, and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Users/Usecase**\n",
        "\n",
        "From our perspective, the people who will benefit most from our chatbot are users who want quick, general nutrition guidance without dealing with confusing or unreliable online sources. This includes beginners learning about healthy eating, people who want simple explanations, and anyone who feels overwhelmed by online diet content. We designed the use case to be a straightforward chat interface where users type questions and receive safe, evidence-based responses grounded directly in our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**where/how they'll be using the model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "We expect users to interact with our model through a lightweight chatbot interface, either on a web app or through an interactive notebook. Our goal is for people to use it in everyday situations; for example, when planning meals, trying to understand healthy habits, or wanting quick reminders about balanced eating. Since the model retrieves real text from reliable sources, users get accurate information instantly without needing to browse multiple websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "**what kind of data it requires?**\n",
        "\n",
        "To build this system, we needed data that is both reliable and allowed for academic use. We collected text from Canada’s Food Guide and WHO Healthy Diet resources because these are publicly available educational materials. We cleaned the text, split it into smaller chunks; and turned it into embeddings so the chatbot can retrieve the right information when a user asks a question. Our model does not collect or store personal user data, it only uses the user’s question to retrieve the correct evidence and generate an answer.\n"

In contrast, the RAG-enhanced version retrieved relevant information from our curated nutrition dataset and generated a response grounded in evidence-based sources such as Canada’s Food Guide and WHO recommendations. The RAG answer was clearer, more accurate, and aligned with public-health principles, demonstrating a clear improvement in safety, relevance, and grounding."
