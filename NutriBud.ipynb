        "**Project Overview**\n",
        "In our project, we are creating NutriBud, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to give safe, evidence-based nutrition guidance. We built this system because we wanted to create a tool that doesn’t rely on random internet information, but instead pulls directly from trusted health sources like Canada’s Food Guide and the World Health Organization. Our chatbot uses retrieval to gather verified information and a language model to summarize it into clear, simple responses. Since we are focusing on general healthy eating, our system avoids giving medical or extreme diet advice and instead supports users with educational nutrition information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem**\n",
        "\n",
        "While working on this project, we realized how difficult it is for people to access reliable nutrition information online. Many websites, influencers, and social media platforms share conflicting or unsafe diet advice, which can easily confuse users. A lot of people end up relying on viral trends instead of evidence-based recommendations. We wanted to solve this problem by building a chatbot that only uses trustworthy public-health information and provides consistent, safe guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**significance**\n",
        "\n",
        "As we researched different ideas, we quickly saw how much misinformation exists in the nutrition space. This problem felt meaningful to us because we noticed that students, newcomers to Canada, and busy individuals often struggle to identify what is actually healthy or safe. Since we are working with official health sources, our project gives users a way to access dependable information without having to navigate complex government websites. To us, the significance of this project lies in making nutrition education more accessible, culturally neutral, and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Users/Usecase**\n",
        "\n",
        "From our perspective, the people who will benefit most from our chatbot are users who want quick, general nutrition guidance without dealing with confusing or unreliable online sources. This includes beginners learning about healthy eating, people who want simple explanations, and anyone who feels overwhelmed by online diet content. We designed the use case to be a straightforward chat interface where users type questions and receive safe, evidence-based responses grounded directly in our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**where/how they'll be using the model?**\n",
        "\n",
        "We expect users to interact with our model through a lightweight chatbot interface, either on a web app or through an interactive notebook. Our goal is for people to use it in everyday situations; for example, when planning meals, trying to understand healthy habits, or wanting quick reminders about balanced eating. Since the model retrieves real text from reliable sources, users get accurate information instantly without needing to browse multiple websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "**what kind of data it requires?**\n",
        "\n",
        "To build this system, we needed data that is both reliable and allowed for academic use. We collected text from Canada’s Food Guide and WHO Healthy Diet resources because these are publicly available educational materials. We cleaned the text, split it into smaller chunks; and turned it into embeddings so the chatbot can retrieve the right information when a user asks a question. Our model does not collect or store personal user data, it only uses the user’s question to retrieve the correct evidence and generate an answer.\n"

For example, when we asked the baseline model “What is healthy eating?”, the model simply repeated the exact same question back to us and produced no meaningful answer at all. This behavior highlights how weak the underlying GPT-2/DistilGPT-2 generator is when it does not have access to reliable context. The situation became even more absurd in our RAG test: after retrieving excellent nutrition passages from Canada’s Food Guide and WHO, the model was given high-quality evidence but still generated a completely nonsensical response such as, “You are not eating too much… you are eating too much… you are eating too much,” repeated dozens of times. Although these results were funny, they clearly illustrate a serious technical point: even with retrieval, a small, unfine-tuned language model cannot reliably follow instructions, obey guardrails, or stay grounded in the provided context. The humor of these outputs actually helps emphasize the need for stronger generation models or safer extractive methods in health-related RAG applications."

        "In our testing phase, we designed two sets of questions: five “normal” user questions about healthy eating and five “stress-test” questions that intentionally pushed the model toward medical, weight-loss, or highly personalized advice. For each question, we ran two versions of our system: (1) the original RAG pipeline that used a small GPT-style generator to summarize the retrieved context, and (2) our final extractive RAG version, which simply returns grounded text from the retrieved nutrition documents with a short introductory phrase. We then compared the outputs side by side to see how well each version followed our safety goals and stayed faithful to the evidence in our curated dataset."

        "From these tests, we observed that the generative RAG version often ignored our instructions, hallucinated repetitive or nonsensical sentences, and sometimes introduced content that did not appear anywhere in our sources. This is especially risky in a health-related domain. In contrast, the extractive RAG version consistently returned factual, guideline-style text directly from Canada’s Food Guide, WHO, and Heart & Stroke documents, even for stress-test questions about weight loss or diabetes. Based on these observations, we chose to keep the generative version only as a “what can go wrong” baseline and present the extractive version as our final design, because it better matches our original goal: a simple, conservative chatbot that prioritizes safety and evidence over creativity."

        "once our local version was working smoothly, we created a new space on hugging face, uploaded app.py, requirements.txt, and pushed our project files. we expected the space to run exactly like our local environment, so this step was mainly about getting everything online and letting hugging face build the container."

        "as soon as our space built, we realized something was wrong because it kept crashing with a numpy normalization error. at first we thought it was a model issue, but after reading through the logs we noticed something strange: the app said it found “0 files in data.” that’s when we discovered the issue — our .gitignore file was accidentally ignoring the entire data/ folder, so none of our nutrition documents were actually uploaded to hugging face. without any chunks to embed, the embedding matrix was empty, which caused the crash.\n",
        "after fixing that, we ran into a second challenge related to gradio. the version of gradio on hugging face spaces did not support custom arguments like css= or theme= inside Blocks or ChatInterface. even though these features appear in tutorials, the actual runtime version rejected them and crashed instantly. this made customizing our UI much harder because every attempt to add styling led to runtime errors."

        "for the gradio issue, we changed our entire UI approach. instead of forcing unsupported features like custom css or themes, we simplified the layout to a clean gr.ChatInterface. this version works across all gradio versions and gave us a stable chat-style interface similar to chatgpt. this fix removed all ui-related crashes and allowed the app to run reliably on hugging face spaces."
